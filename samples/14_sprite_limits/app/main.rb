 APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

 - Instance variable (@): Used to give objects their own space to store data.
   Used in this sample app when the class data structure is chosen to assign
   star values, like the position, speed, size, color, etc. Check the
   initialize method inside of the StarClass class to see @ used.

 Reminders:

 - args.outputs.sprites: An array. The values generate a sprite.
   The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, IMAGE PATH]
   For more information about sprites, go to mygame/documentation/05-sprites.md.

 - args.outputs.labels: An array. The values generate a label.
   The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGNMENT, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
   For more information about labels, go to mymgame/documentation/02-labels.md.

 - Symbol (:): Ruby object with a name and an internal ID. Symbols are useful
   because with a given symbol name, you can refer to the same object throughout
   a Ruby program.

 - args.state.new_entity: Used when we want to create a new object, like a sprite or button.
   For example, if we want to create a new button, we would declare it as a new entity and
   then define its properties. (Remember, you can use state to define ANY property and it will
   be retained across frames.)

 - to_s: Returns a string representation of an object.

 - to_i: Returns an integer representation of an object.

 - String interpolation: uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
   as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

 - args.inputs.mouse.(x|y): The x and y location of the mouse.
   For more information about the mouse, go to mygame/documentation/07-mouse.md.

                    HELLO!!!!
================================================

This sample app shows the performance differences between using
a very flexible data structure (:entity),
a less flexible but faster data structure (:strict),
and the least flexible but fastest data structure (:class).

To see the differences use the `reset_with SPRITE_COUNT, CATEGORY` method.

For example, the following invocations generate 100 sprites of each data structure type:

    reset_with 100, :entity
    reset_with 100, :strict
    reset_with 100, :class

and these commands generate 1k sprites of each data structure type:

    reset_with 1000, :entity
    reset_with 1000, :strict
    reset_with 1000, :class
